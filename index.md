# TrueBlue Talks: Machine Learning

First introductory talk about machine learning in TrueBlue.

Pre-requisites:
 - Python basic knowledge
 - Conda installed
 - Would be nice if everyone has the environment already installed, it takes time

Please watch the intro at [ML-Tour](https://sabau.github.io/ml-tour/)
